# HockeyRef Game Tracker

## About
This repository contains a .NET 8 project utilizing C# that leverages Selenium to scrape public data for tax preparation purposes. Specifically, it retrieves game details that I have officiated in the German hockey leagues, aiding in the organization and declaration of activities related to my role as an ice hockey referee.

## Technology Stack
- **.NET 8**: The project is built on the .NET 8 framework, ensuring modern features and optimizations are utilized.
- **C#**: Employs the latest stable release of C#, embracing the language's robustness and new features.
- **Selenium**: Automates web browsers to scrape required information from designated web pages.

## Project Status
This codebase is a bit of a complex weave - an intricate pasta-like structure, if you will. While it serves its intended purpose well, it does so with a flair that only a true connoisseur of tangled code can appreciate.

## Disclaimer
The scripts are tailored for specific websites and use cases. They might not adhere to general coding practices and could require a stretch of imagination and a bit of patience to navigate the intertwined code paths.

## Contribution
If youre interested in contribution - for whatever reason - youre welcomed to do so!

## Usage
The tool is for personal use and is designed to assist with personal tax preparation, particularly for those with officiating roles in sports. It is not a commercial product and should be used with discretion.

## License
